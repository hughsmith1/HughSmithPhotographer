<p>	      Main Point #1 Education

Many vocational schools, community colleges and art schools offer photography training. A variety of photography classes are offered from these types of programs and students have the option to obtain a diploma or certification after successful completion of training. These programs generally cover basic photography techniques, as well as the business and marketing side of photography. Because photographers create visual images, many programs also train students how to create a portfolio to showcase their work to potential employers and clients.</p>


<p>      Main Point #2 Keep a Notebook
1.	I recommend creating a well-organized notebook. I still have one that I jot notes in frequently.  You can treat this like a travel log of your experience, a place where you keep notes, set goals, paste trimmings of shots you’ve found that inspire you etc.  You’d be surprised just how many photographers do this.  I’d say at least 50% of my successful photographer friends still have a notebook of this kind and use it frequently. I’ll mention it a bit more as we move on to the other tips.
2.	It is important to acknowledge that for some, it’s just not their thang and I totally get that.  For some people it adds stress and pressure to something that is supposed to be fun.  If you fall into that category, ditch step one and keep moving on to the other tips in the post.</p>



<p>      Main Point #3 Shoot Frequently
1.	If you really want to gain confidence, you should be out shooting as much as you possibly can.  Perhaps it’s every day on your lunch hour.  If that’s the only window you have to consistently squeeze it in, fine.  Just be out shooting frequently and consistently.
2.	NOTHING can replace the benefits of just getting out there and shooting as often as you can. Practice makes perfect after all.</p>


<p>      Main Point #4 Shoot in Different Conditions
1.	Not only should you be shooting regularly, you should be out shooting in different conditions as often as possible to familiarize yourself with them.  A lot of times as photographers we’re searching for good, easy, flat light that isn’t going to throw us any curve balls (ie open shade or an overcast day).  The reality of photography however is that you don’t always have so much control, so you need to be ready for any and everything at any given time.
2.	For example: maybe one week you practice shooting subjects that are backlit and the next you go out and shoot in low light.  Just get out and shoot and shoot and shoot and then come home and record what you learn each day in the corresponding section of your notebook.</p>


<p>       Main Point #5 Set Goals
1.	Is there a particular technique you’d like to learn?  Perhaps there’s a shot you saw and you’d like to attempt to achieve a similar result. Write your goal down in your notebook and keep track of how far you’ve come.
2.	If you’re really brave (and committed to gaining confidence) I recommend that you set your goal publicly (like on your blog, a forum you participate in etc) so that you feel accountable.  Let people know that you’re working on something new and ask for their feedback and any tips they may have.  Then get out and practice like crazy until you get it figured out.</p>


<p>      Main Point #6 Read

1.	There are SO MANY great books out there on photography.  Scott Kelby has some really fantastic ones for beginners and the D.P.S has a great range too.  Make a visit to the bookstore or your local library and get your study on.
2.	Now days there is so much information available for FREE!!!  What Darren has created here at Digital Photography School really is remarkable.  Dig through the archives.  If you don’t find what you’re looking for you can always kick of an email to DPS or directly to one of the writers and give us a post suggestion.  No guarantees, but we really do want to give you what you want and need! We’re here to help you succeed!</p>


<p>        Main Point #7 Ask Questions
1.	Sometimes photographers have a hard time asking questions. Why do so many of us like to look like we’ve got it all figured out?  It’s baffling.  Asking questions frequently will help you feel certain you’re going about things in the right way and that’s a HUGE step toward gaining lasting confidence.</p>
